- Every cell has a up-down-left-right class which adds border.
- When the neighor is the same number, removes the respective class
- make it negative case: Add border class if number is different

- Test out different solving-algorithms, like BFS, Greedy, A*
- Try to solve them on paper first -> Get the info out of your brain

- Based on the ID you can intially create borders permanently
- The '9' (walls) can be skipped in the BoardMap if I provide the width and length of the board
