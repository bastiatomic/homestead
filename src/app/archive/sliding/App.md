- Test out different solving-algorithms, like BFS, Greedy, A*
- Try to solve them on paper first -> Get the info out of your brain

- The '9' (walls) can be skipped in the BoardMap if I provide the width and length of the board

- 0: empty
- 1: victoryId (assumptions)
- no borders allowed (historical the 9)
