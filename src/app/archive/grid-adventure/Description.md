The Hamster is a minigame in Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box. It is unlocked in the Molentary Express' kitchen, when Luke Triton finds Macaroon's, the Molentary Express' chef, Hamster. The chef admits that the hamster is his and that he lets him eat all he wants. As such, he asks Luke if he could help the hamster do some exercise. Luke agrees and takes the Hamster with him on his travels with Professor Layton. Upon doing so, the minigame is available, and the player is free to name the hamster.


The player has to find the Hamster toys by solving puzzles, and use them to exercise the hamster. Each toy type has a unique skill. The hamster will prefer walking towards the closest toy, unless there is a certain one it likes more, or a skill is activated. The toys must be put within three spaces from the hamster's position (which changes as it walks), otherwise it won't be able to spot them.

Every time the hamster achieves a certain goal of steps, it gets skinnier and its level changes. The hamster's level begins at 5, and goes downwards as the hamster achieves more step goals. Once the hamster's level reaches 0, then the minigame is complete, and the Animal Lover's House is added to Layton's Challenges.
